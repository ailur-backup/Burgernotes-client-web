    <h2 class="w300">Information we collect while using our services</h2>
    <p>When you create a note, we collect and use this information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Encrypted note content and title</li>
        <p>This is used so that you may retrieve the note later</p>

        <p>This is used so that we can make sure your note is not given to anyone else</p>

    </ul>

        <p>This is used so that your notes are listed by age</p>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="w300">How we use your data</h2>
    <p>We use your data to make our services work. We don't share your information with third-parties.</p>
    <h2 class="w300">We can't see the content and title of the notes you create</h2>
    <p>Your notes are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption">encrypted end-to-end</a> using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation">CBC</a>
        (Advanced Encryption Standard - Cipher Block Chaining) 256-bit encryption.</p>
    <p>We can only see:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Note creation date</li>
        <p>This is used so that your notes are listed by age if no edited date exists</p>
        <li>Note last edited date</li>
        <p>This is used so that your notes are listed by age</p>
        <li>Note creator</li>
        <p>This is used	so that we can make sure your note is not given to anyone else</p>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Not</b> note content or title.</p>
    <h2 class="w300">Use of cookies</h2>
    <p>Burgernotes does not use cookies in the conventional sense. Burgernotes places infomation into localStorage, a type of blob storage similar to cookies, but not accessible to third-party websites or the server.</p>
    <p>This ensures that a malicious server or third-party websites cannot tell your infomation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>DONOTSHARE-secretkey</li>
        <p>This is used by the client to send to the server in order to identify you as... you.</p>
        <p>This contains no useful infomation and is simply a string of random bytes. If this is shared, you may simply remove the offending secretKey from your session list, by clicking "X" on the device you have logged in on to create this key.</p>
        <li>DONOTSHARE-password</li>
        <p>This is used by the aformentioned AES to encrypt and decrypt your notes. It never leaves your device.</p>
        <p>This is derived from your password and is therefore sensitive and should NEVER, EVER be shared. If you have done so, change your password as soon as possible.</p>
        <li>SETTING-fontsize</li>
        <p>This is used to determine the size of your font. It is not sensitive infomation and can be freely shared, though it never leaves your device.</p>
        <li>FIRSTVISIT</li>
        <p>This is used to determine if the user guide should be played, showing on a mobile device how touch gestures are used. It is not sensitive infomation and can be freely shared, though it never leaves your device.</p>
        <li>NEWVERSION<li>
        <p>This determines if you have seen the "What's New?" dialouge displayed in each new version. It is not sensitive infomation and can be freely shared, though it never leaves your device.</p>
        <li>homeserver</li>
        <p>This determines which server Burgernotes should connect to. It is not sensitive infomation and can be freely shared, though it never leaves your device.</li>
    <h2 class="w300">We don't sell your data</h2>
    <p>We don't sell or share your data to advertisers or third-parties, and no such thing exists on this website - it is entirely self-contained. Not even an external font service is used.</p>
    <h2 class="w300">Liability</h2>
    <p>We take no responsibility for the use of Burgernotes, or any external instances provided by third-parties. We
        refuse liability for any inappropriate or illegal use of Burgernotes, as it is not within our power to prevent it.</p>
    <p>This is a summerisation of the below paragraph, found in AGPL-3.0, as linked above.</p>
    <p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
    THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
    GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
    USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
    DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
    PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
    EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
    SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
    <p>Burgernotes comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
    <p>Burgernotes is compatible with the UK GDPR and the Californian Data Protection Regulation. We do not knowingly serve citizens in the European Union, and those who do so do so at their own risk. The only violating law of the EU GDPR is that it is no longer hosted in an EU country after the events of Brexit.</p>
