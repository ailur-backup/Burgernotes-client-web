    <h1 class="w300">Burgernotes Privacy Policy &amp; Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <h2 class="w300">Preamble</h2>
    <p><i>Please note that I am not a lawyer. If you find any issues in this privacy policy, please create an issue <a href="https://concord.hectabit.org/HectaBit/Burgernotes/issues/new">on our git repository</a>.</i></p>
    <p>Welcome to the Burgernotes privacy policy! Burgernotes is <a
             href="https://concord.hectabit.org/hectabit/burgernotes">free & open source</a> software licensed under the <a
            href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">GNU AGPL-3.0</a>.</p>
    <p>In this document, the terms "we" and "us" refer to the Hectabit Project, an open source initiative and the creator of Burgernotes. The terms "you" and "the user" refer to the reader of this privacy policy and all users of Burgernotes. "This website" and "this service" refer to Burgernotes, an online website you are currently using.</p>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
    <h2 class="w300">Your rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to access, rectify, and erase your personal data. To exercise these rights, please contact us by email at admin@hectabit.org with the subject line "Burgernotes Privacy Rights." We will respond to your request as soon as possible.</p>
    <h2 class="w300">Your Data</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored 100% on-premise, meaning it remains within our infrastructure and is not accessible to third parties. Additionally, all note data is encrypted on your device using AES-GCM 256-bit encryption, as specified later. This ensures that even we cannot access the content of your notes.</p>
    <h2 class="w300">Information collected when signing up</h2>
    <p>When signing up for an account, we collect and store the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="w600">Username, and your password hashed</li>
        <li>This is used to authenticate you into our service when you log in</li>
        <li class="w600">Date of account creation</li>
        <li>This is used so that we can see inactive accounts and suspend them</li>
        <li class="w600">Web browser "User Agent"</li>
        <li>This is used, so you are able to recognise your devices signing in to your account</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="w300">Information collected when logging in</h2>
    <p>When logging back in to your account, we collect and store the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="w600">Web browser "User agent"</li>
        <li>This is used, so you are able to recognise your devices signing in to your account</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="w300">Information we collect while using our services</h2>
    <p>When you create a note, we collect and use this information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="w600">Encrypted note content and title</li>
        <li>This is used so that you may retrieve the note later</li>
        <li class="w600">Note creator</li>
        <li>This is used so that we can make sure your note is not given to anyone else</li>
        <li class="w600">Note creation date</li>
        <li>This is used so that your notes are listed by age if no edited date exists</li>
        <li class="w600">Note last edited date</li>
        <li>This is used so that your notes are listed by age</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you edit a note, we collect and use this information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="w600">Encrypted note content and title</li>
        <li>This is used so that you may retrieve the note later</li>
        <li class="w600">Note last edited date</li>
        <li>This is used so that your notes are listed by age</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="w300">How we use your data</h2>
    <p>We use your data to make our services work. We don't share your information with third-parties.</p>
    <h2 class="w300">We can't see the content and title of the notes you create</h2>
    <p>Your notes are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption">encrypted end-to-end</a> using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode">GCM</a> (Advanced Encryption Standard - Galois / Counter Mode) 256-bit encryption.</p>
    <p>We can only see:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="w600">Note creation date</li>
        <li>This is used so that your notes are listed by age if no edited date exists</li>
        <li class="w600">Note last edited date</li>
        <li>This is used so that your notes are listed by age</li>
        <li class="w600">Note creator</li>
        <li>This is used	so that we can make sure your note is not given to anyone else</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Not</b> note content or title.</p>
    <h2 class="w300">Use of cookies</h2>
    <p>Burgernotes does not use cookies in the conventional sense. Burgernotes places information into localStorage, a type of blob storage similar to cookies, but not accessible to third-party websites or the server.</p>
    <p>This ensures that a malicious server or third-party websites cannot tell your information.</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="w600">PRIVATE-secretKey</li>
        <li>This is used by the client to send to the server in order to identify you as... you.</li>
        <li>This contains no useful information and is simply a string of random bytes. If this is shared, you may simply remove the offending secretKey from your session list, by clicking "X" on the device you have logged in on to create this key.</li>
        <li class="w600">PRIVATE-cryptoKey</li>
        <li>This is used by the aforementioned AES to encrypt and decrypt your notes. It never leaves your device.</li>
        <li>This is derived from your password and is therefore sensitive and should NEVER, EVER be shared. If you have done so, change your password as soon as possible.</li>
        <li class="w600">SETTING-fontsize</li>
        <li>This is used to determine the size of your font. It is not sensitive information and can be freely shared, though it never leaves your device.</li>
        <li class="w600">SETTING-newVersion</li>
        <li>This determines if you have seen the "What's New?" dialog displayed in each new version. It is not sensitive information and can be freely shared, though it never leaves your device.</li>
        <li class="w600">SETTING-homeServer</li>
        <li>This determines which server Burgernotes should connect to. It is not sensitive information and can be freely shared, though it never leaves your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="w300">We don't sell your data</h2>
    <p>We don't sell or share your data to advertisers or third-parties, and no such thing exists on this website - it is entirely self-contained. Not even an external font service is used.</p>
    <h2 class="w300">Liability</h2>
    <p>We take no responsibility for the use of Burgernotes, or any external instances provided by third-parties. We refuse liability for any inappropriate or illegal use of Burgernotes, as it is not within our power to prevent it.</p>
    <p>This is a summarization of the below paragraph, found in AGPL-3.0, as linked above.</p>
    <p class="w500">IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
    <p>Burgernotes comes with <b>ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY</b>, to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
    <p>Burgernotes is compatible with the UK GDPR and the Californian Data Protection Regulation. We do not knowingly serve citizens in the European Union, and those who do so at their own risk. The only violating law of the EU GDPR is that it is no longer hosted in an EU country after the events of Brexit.</p>
